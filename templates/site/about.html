          Madison Vance believes that buying or selling a home shouldn’t be lost
          in a maze of generic real-estate portals. She wanted a custom,
          modern website that keeps the focus on what matters most:
          clear information, beautiful photography, and a simple way to reach her
          directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is built around Madison’s day-to-day work as a full-service
          real-estate professional in the Omaha area. Every property is presented
          with a detailed description, a curated set of photos, and easy access
          to the key facts buyers care about.
        </p>

        <h2 class="ld-section-title">How this site helps you</h2>
        <ul style="padding-left: 1.1rem; margin: 0 0 1rem;">
          <li>
            Browse up-to-date listings with full addresses, prices, and
            rich property descriptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly see each home’s style (Tudor, Ranch, Townhome, Condominium,
            and more) and the neighborhood it belongs to, such as Downtown,
            Benson, Happy Hollow, or Rockbrook.
          </li>
          <li>
            View four high-quality photos for every property and use the
            <em>Contact about this home</em> button on each listing to email
            Madison directly with questions or to schedule a showing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check the status of each property at a glance:
            <strong>Available</strong>, <strong>Pending</strong>, or
            <strong>Sold</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discover the Featured Property on the home page — Madison selects
            one standout listing each week so you can see what’s new and
            noteworthy right away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use powerful search tools to filter by home type, neighborhood,
            or price range in $50,000 increments, so you only see homes that
            truly fit your budget and lifestyle.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Behind the scenes, Madison reviews search reports each month to
          understand which home types, neighborhoods, and price ranges are most
          popular. That insight helps her price new listings wisely and keep
          her clients informed about market trends.
